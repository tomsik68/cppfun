* =one_of<T>=
  Checks if given value of type =T= is part of a set of values given at compile-time.
At the moment, it is known to work with integral types and both scoped and unscoped enums.

The advantage is cleaner source.
What you would write like this:

#+begin_src cpp
  int i = 15;

  if (i == 1 || i == 3 || i == 7 || i == 10) {
    cout << "i has special value!";
   }
#+end_src

Can be simplified to:
#+begin_src cpp
  int i = 15;

  if (one_of<decltype(i), 1, 3, 7, 10>()(i)) {
    cout << "i has special value!";
   }
#+end_src
